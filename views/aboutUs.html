    I am passionate about handicraft. For Estonian women has it been always very important: it is the way, how we identify ourselves. The patterns, the colours, the need – it is always combined together. Traditional craft skills are an essential part of our mental cultural heritage.

    <br>
        		
	We would like to share our heritage to the world: to show our national wealth and craft skill to the world.

	Mission of our company: 
	</p>
				
	<ul>
		<li>			
			To offer our e-shop customers Estonian handycraft products, ecologically clean, healthy, made of Baltic region raw materials and by the local labour force;								
		</li>
					
		<li>			
			To raise the awareness of customers with regard to the natural materials used for Estonian handicraft objects, i.e. to promote folk traditions and cultural and historical heritage, and make a real impression;			
		</li>
					
		<li>
			To provide employment, opportunities for additional means of subsistence and marketing-related support to the craft masters of rural areas and from among the older generation, all over Estonia (currently, the Estonian handicraft makers have only one possibility to sell outside Estonia – taking their goods to craft shops targeted at potential foreign tourists); 					
		</li>

			To support local active groups and people, and to enhance the mutual communication; to support small-size entrepreneurship and favour the emergence of companies with a small number of staff, to support traditions and the creation of entrepreneurial networks aimed at better marketing of products.
